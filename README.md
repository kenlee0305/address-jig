# address-jig

This is a simple tool to generate a bunch of possible shipping addresses from a single address. This will allow multiple orders to be shipped from stores that limit orders per address such as Supreme NY.

An example of this tool can be seen at: https://fuzzyavocado.github.io/address-jig/
